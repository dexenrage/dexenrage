# About Me

I am a ambitious and creative person who is passionate about programming and constant self-development.

My curiosity and passion for knowledge lead me to study various programming languages and technologies. I appreciate intelligence and creativity in other people and strive to communicate with equally motivated and talented people.

In my free time, I enjoy video games, movies, music and travel, as well as anime, and the successes of my friends and acquaintances inspire me to achieve my own achievements.
